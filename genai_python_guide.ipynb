    "### 4.1 Testing & Quality Control\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test locally**: Run the code in a local environment or a Jupyter notebook cell to ensure it works with your specific dataset.\n",
    "- **Check logic**: Make sure the code makes sense. AI can sometimes produce code that “looks right” but has logical errors.\n",
    "- **Use version control**: Tools like Git can help you compare changes and keep track of when and where AI-generated snippets are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Transparency & Academic Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "In academic or scientific contexts, be explicit about your sources. For instance, in the comments or documentation of your notebook, note:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Code in this section was generated with the assistance of [Model Name / ChatGPT / Bing Chat / etc.] on [Date].”\n",
    "\n",
    "This transparency allows future readers (and your instructors) to understand how the code was produced, and it adheres to ethical standards of attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Recording Your Prompts\n",
    "To fully document your use of GenAI, please use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Maintain a Prompt Log**: Keep a simple text file or Markdown file where you copy/paste the exact prompts you used, along with the date and time. This is helpful for assignments or projects requiring detailed provenance.\n",
    "2. **Include Prompts in an Appendix**: If you’re submitting a written report or Jupyter notebook, you could add an \"Appendix\" section listing all the prompts you asked. This is particularly useful if you iterated several times on your queries.\n",
    "3. **Inline Comments**: In your code, you can add brief comments noting the prompt or question you asked. For instance:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Prompt: \"Explain how to calculate a 5-year rolling average on this dataset.\"\n",
    "   # Response was adapted and verified on 2023-08-10.\n",
    "   ```\n",
