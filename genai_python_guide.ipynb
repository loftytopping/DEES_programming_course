    "# Using Generative AI to Help Write Python Code\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, Generative AI (GenAI)—large language models such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, and GitHub Copilot—have become powerful tools that can assist with writing or explaining code. In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show basic ways to prompt a GenAI system to write or explain Python code.  \n",
    "2. Highlight how prompts can significantly affect the quality of the output.  \n",
    "3. Discuss the importance of being transparent about when and how you used GenAI in your workflow.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\n",
    "**Key takeaway**: GenAI can be a helpful assistant, but it’s not a replacement for your own understanding or thorough testing. Always treat GenAI as a coding partner, *not* an infallible authority.\n"

    "1. **Prompt Strategy**: The better your prompt, the better the output.  \n",
    "2. **Verify the Code**: Always review and test any code that GenAI provides.  \n",
    "3. **Document Your Usage**: If you use or adapt code generated by an AI model, cite it in your project or notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some guidelines for your prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be **specific**.  \n",
    "- Provide **context** (e.g., the type of data you are working with).  \n",

    "1. **Use Step-by-Step Queries**:  \n",
    "   Break down your requests rather than asking for everything at once. For example:  \n",
    "   - “Write a Python function that reads a CSV file.”  \n",
    "   - “Now show how to plot the data using matplotlib.”  \n",
    "   - “Explain how to annotate the plot with a line for the mean anomaly.”  \n",

    "2. **Ask for Explanations or Alternatives**:  \n",

    "   - “Explain each line of the code so I understand how it works.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate**:  \n",
