    "Welcome to the first practical in our Python programming course. Over the course of this module we are going to take an applied approach to learning Python. We do this by working through examples of basic numerical computation to data input and analysis. We cannot teach you everything Python has to offer in this course, but we can give you a set of tools to begin your journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical we are going to cover some core operations most Python programs will have. This gives you chance to learn the syntax that the Python interpreter expects. Remember, learning to program is similar to learning any other language, including a general appreciation of what the hardware underneath the software is doing. This course will provide you with a number of templates to keep and maybe modify and re-use as you build up your own expanding library of examples.\n",
